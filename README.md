# Syndicator

This is a Ruby on Rails Application for a Code Challenge Project. The application automates a syndication process for events to be reposted on five different websites (assumed you are logged in to each platform). The Rufus Scheduler gem checks the database every hour, and if there are new entries, the Mechanize gem syndicates the data to the websites.

## To run this app:
Fork and clone the repository. Run bundle install inside the directory and start a local server.
